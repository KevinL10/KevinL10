### Hi!

I'm Kevin, a second-year Mathematics and Computer Science student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). I currently work as a research assistant at [The Reliable, Secure, and Sustainable Software Lab](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/mjulia/ReSeSS.html) and captain UBC's Capture The Flag Team, [Maple Bacon](https://maplebacon.org/).


Some cool projects I've worked on:

- [📚 Knetwork](https://github.com/KevinL10/Knetwork): an offline-first learning management system, featuring progress tracking and unlimited AI-generated problems
- [🔒 Blocky](https://github.com/KevinL10/blocky): an interactive application for building cryptographic block ciphers ([substitution-permutation networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution%E2%80%93permutation_network))
- [📈 Derivify](https://github.com/KevinL10/derivify): visualizing derivatives of functions graphs with Bezier curves and least square polynomials
- [🎄 Advent of Code](https://github.com/KevinL10/advent-of-code): solutions to the annual Advent of Code challenge, where I've placed top 150 in both 2021 and 2022
